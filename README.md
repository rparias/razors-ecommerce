# razors svelte app

This is a project used to learn svelte. Available to run locally using npm or Docker.

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed or [Docker](https://docker.com)_

## Get started

### Option 1 with npm:

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd razors-ecommernce
npm install
```

...then start:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

### Option 2 with Docker:

```bash
cd razors-ecommernce
```

...then start:

```bash
docker run --name razors-ecommerce -d -p 8080:80 rparias/razors
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for _any_ path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```

## Deploying to the web

### With [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Install `vercel` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
vercel deploy --name my-project
```
